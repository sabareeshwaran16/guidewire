# 🛡️ StillPaid  
### AI-Powered Parametric Insurance for Gig Workers  

> **“Ensuring gig workers are still paid, even when they cannot work.”**

---

## 📌 Overview

StillPaid is an AI-powered parametric insurance platform designed to protect gig delivery workers from income loss caused by external disruptions such as extreme weather, pollution, and city restrictions.

Unlike traditional insurance, StillPaid uses event-based triggers to automatically initiate claims and process payouts, eliminating manual verification and delays.

---

## ❗ Problem Statement

Gig delivery partners working with platforms like Swiggy and Zomato depend entirely on daily earnings.

However, external disruptions such as:

- 🌧 Heavy Rain  
- 🌡 Extreme Heat  
- 🌫 Severe Pollution  
- 🚫 Curfews / Restrictions  

can reduce their working hours and lead to 20–30% income loss.

Currently, there is no system that protects this lost income.

## 📊 Parametric Triggers

| Disruption | Condition         | Base Payout |
|------------|------------------|-------------|
| 🌧 Rain    | > 50mm/day       | ₹300        |
| 🌡 Heat    | > 42°C           | ₹250        |
| 🌫 AQI     | > 350            | ₹200        |
| 🚫 Curfew  | Govt restriction | ₹400        |

👉 *Actual payout may vary based on disruption severity and selected coverage plan.*

---

## 💰 Weekly Pricing Model

| Plan     | Weekly Premium | Coverage |
|----------|---------------|----------|
| Basic    | ₹30/week      | ₹300     |
| Standard | ₹50/week      | ₹500     |
| Premium  | ₹70/week      | ₹700     |

👉 Premiums dynamically adjust based on risk levels.

---

## 🔹 Adaptive Parametric Payout

Instead of fixed payouts, StillPaid uses dynamic payout tiers based on disruption severity.

**Example — Premium Plan (Coverage: ₹700):**

- Low Impact → ₹300  
- Medium Impact → ₹500  
- High Impact → ₹700  

This ensures fair compensation while maintaining parametric logic.

---

## 🔐 Verification & Fraud Prevention

StillPaid uses a data-driven verification pipeline.

### Verification

- External APIs validate disruption events  
- Events mapped to geographic zones  
- Workers filtered based on location and time  

### Fraud Control

- One payout per trigger  
- Location consistency checks  
- Time-window validation  

The system is fully automated, transparent, and fraud-resistant.

## 🤖 WhatsApp-Based Worker Verification

To simplify onboarding:

1. Worker registers on StillPaid  
2. Connects WhatsApp account  
3. Chatbot collects:
   - Delivery platform

   - Location  
4. Profile is verified before activation  

### Benefits
